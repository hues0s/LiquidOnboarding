# Liquid Onboarding
Welcome to the Liquid Onboarding iOS Template!
This template, built entirely with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/), is designed to help you create a visually appealing and interactive onboarding experience for your own iOS projects.

## Features

* Easy to customize: you can easily change the color scheme and layout of the onboarding screens to match your app's branding.
* Integrates [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) animations for a dynamic and engaging experience.
* Responsive design: the template is designed to work on all iOS devices.
